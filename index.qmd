## Purpose

Join me on a journey of continuous learning by exploring the skills necessary for data analysis: data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and effective communication.

I believe that data analytics and transformational public policy are essential for creating positive change in our communities and society at large. Through the use of data and evidence-based approaches, we can identify and address societal challenges more effectively and efficiently.

We are the path towards a better future for society as a whole.
