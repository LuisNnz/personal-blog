    "text": "As an advocate for equitable and transformational public policy, I combine my research and data analysis skills with my personal experiences using economic security programs to assess policy proposals. As a research associate at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, I collaborate with analysts and researchers to advance federal legislation to help build a nation where everyone has the resources to thrive and share in the nation’s prosperity. I’m committed to advocating for data-focused policy solutions for an inclusive economy while enhancing fiscal responsibility. I seek continuous learning in data analytics and research within a transformational public policy framework."
